Also, regular code files only allow you to add notes using comments, which makes it hard to explain your thinking alongside your code.\n",

Think of it like a recipe where you can test individual steps without making the whole dish. Between these code cells, you can add explanatory text (like this section) to guide yourself and others through your thinking.\n",

In other languages, you'd have to declare a variable's type upfront. Python doesn't care about this. You could start with a number in a variable, then swap it out for text later. This gives you freedom but also requires careful attention, since you need to remember what each variable contains.\n"
